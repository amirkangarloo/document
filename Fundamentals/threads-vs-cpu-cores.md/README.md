# Are Threads the Same as CPU Cores?

**Short Answer:** ‚ùå **No**, a **thread is not the same** as a **CPU core** ‚Äî but they are related.

## üìå CPU Core vs Thread ‚Äì What's the Difference?

### üß† CPU Core
- A **CPU core** is a **physical hardware unit** inside the processor.
- Each core can execute **one thread at a time** (without hyper-threading).
- Modern CPUs have multiple cores (e.g., 4, 8, 16, etc.).
- Some CPUs support **Hyper-Threading (Intel)** or **Simultaneous Multi-Threading (AMD SMT)**, allowing **each core to run 2 threads** simultaneously ‚Äî these are called **logical threads**.

---

### üßµ Thread (Software Thread)
- A **thread** is a **software unit of execution**.
- It exists within a **process** and shares memory with other threads in the same process.
- You can have many threads per core ‚Äî the OS manages how and when they run.
- Software threads are **scheduled by the operating system** to run on available hardware threads (logical CPUs).

---

## üîÅ Example Scenario

A CPU with:
- **4 physical cores**
- **Each core supports 2 threads via Hyper-Threading**

‚û°Ô∏è This gives **8 logical threads (hardware threads)**.

However, you can still create **100+ software threads** ‚Äî the OS will switch between them rapidly on those 8 hardware threads.

## üéØ Threads in Node.js Context

### Node.js uses:
- A **single thread for JavaScript execution** (event loop).
- A **libuv thread pool** (default 4 threads) for I/O-heavy tasks.
- **`worker_threads`** for actual multi-threaded JavaScript execution.
- The OS will schedule these threads on the available CPU cores/threads.

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Concept                 | Type           | Managed By        | Example                  |
|-------------------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **CPU Core**            | Physical       | Hardware          | Intel Core i7 Core #2    |
| **Hardware Thread**     | Logical        | Hardware (CPU)    | Thread 1 of Core 2       |
| **Software Thread**     | Logical        | OS / Runtime      | Node.js worker thread    |

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Threads are **not the same** as CPU cores.  
 - A **core** is hardware.  
 - A **thread** is a unit of execution that runs on a core.  
 - Multiple threads can run on a single core via OS-level scheduling or hardware features like Hyper-Threading.
